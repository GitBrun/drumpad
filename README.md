# drumpad by Kylian Brun H1G1

Welcome 👋  

Here is my first drumpad, to start with here are the features I've done 🤏

🔑 I made a drumpad where 6 different sounds can be played.

🔑 I then put a button to adjust the volume of these beats

🔑 I made a button at the top that launches a music by michael Jackson for your own remix!

🔑 I make a transition when you play the beats in JS for the aesthetic

SO NOW FREESTYLE 🎸
